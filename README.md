Inspiration
Pregnant women in rural Bangladesh lack access to the appropriate healthcare services required to have a successful and 
healthy pregnancy. Without reliable access to well-trained healthcare professionals, women in higher-risk pregnancies can 
experience higher mortality rates due to delayed care, lack of care, and misinformation. After speaking with Plan Canada 
to gain an understanding of the health workers’ usage of data and the ways they currently gather this information, we
learned the gaps in their process. Currently, community health workers do risk assessments during appointments but
can’t interpret this information into recommendations on their own. Instead, this information must travel back to their
office and be communicated to medical professionals for interpretation. This causes delays in communication and the
creation of important care plans. Information can get lost along the way and takes too long to make an impact for 
these women. Meanwhile, women have poor access to accurate health information and may proceed with their pregnancy 
with misinformation that can be dangerous. They also have limited access to health care workers throughout their 
pregnancy. In order to tackle this issue we looked at developing a more efficient process for the community health
workers that are at the forefront of aiding these women, and created a process that empowers them to plan for their
pregnancies without giving up their cultural practices.

Our Solution
Our solution is “Call Aunty”! This is a two part program that targets both the community health worker (CHW) as well
as the pregnant women (let’s call her Aisha) living in rural Bangladesh. The Call Aunty process starts with a call from 
Aisha, initially with the help of her CHW during their first appointment. At this point Aisha meets Aunty who asks her
a few personal and health related questions to register her into the Call Aunty service. At the end of this call Aunty 
automatically determines Aisha’s risk level, her estimated due date and gives a brief, tailored recommendation based on
the information given. The CHW sees the results of Aisha’s answers on her app as well as the recommendation given by Aunty.
Based on Aisha’s risk level, Call Aunty schedules automated check-in calls to get updates on any symptoms and revise
Aisha’s risk level and recommendations throughout her pregnancy. Our goal is to reduce the number of CHW visits needed for
low-risk women so that these workers can focus on higher-risk women.

Future Development
In the future we hope to scale Call Aunty by: Creating extensive diagnostic questions and recommendations Creating an 
SMS feature to alert CHWs of appointments and nudge women to follow-through on recommendations Develop a scheduler for
CHW to manage appointments Support pre-pregnancy and postnatal (up to a year) Develop a partnership with the government
so that they have access to the Call Aunty database in order to make better healthcare resourcing decisions
